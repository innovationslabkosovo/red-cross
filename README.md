Red Cross works in Kosovo in the field of health sectors to support the basic needs of the population. They offer health education courses in various locations in Kosovo with different target groups of participants. These activities need to be monitored through a Database that can track how many people were trained, in which locations and if their knowledge increased. This is done primarily to track the scores of a pre-test and a post-test of knowledge.
Red Cross Health Education Management Platform allows Red Cross Kosovo to manage the data about trainers, topics, courses, participants and most importantly track their success. It also allows them to print reports with aggregated data for chosen periods and locations.
